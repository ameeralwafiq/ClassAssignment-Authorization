# ClassAssignment-Authorization
## 1. studentDetails.php
- For this assignment, I want to protect this page, which is the Student Details form from the previous assignment. In this form, I have put an authorization layer thus the user that wants to access this form must be authorized first. 
- In order to be authorized, the user are required to log in first, hence they will be redirected back to the login page where they will enter their credentials to be authenticated on whether they are a legit user that exists within the applications record in the database. 
- After they enter their username and password, they will be allowed based on roles and functions. But since the registration form does not have any administrator to monitor, every users that login only can insert their details.
